   15% and saved faculty an average of 10 hours weekly.  
- Optimized website with a responsive layout, increasing mobile user engagement and reducing bounce rate by 25%, ensuring seamless navigation and interaction 
   across multiple devices.

### Implementation of a fault- tolerant 2PC protocol | University of Texas at Arlington 
- Implemented a fault-tolerant Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol in Python, employing TCP sockets for communication between a coordinator and multiple 
    participants. Developed distinct states (INITIAL, WAITING, PRE_COMMIT, COMMIT, ABORT) to manage transaction phases, ensuring each participant registers, votes, 
    and receives final decisions robustly. 
- Incorporated pickle serialization for efficient object transfer, demonstrating proficiency in network programming and distributed systems design. 

## Application of PCA and ICA on Face Recognition Dataset Algorithms | University of Texas at Arlington
- Developed a face recognition system leveraging PCA and ICA for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, resulting in a decrease in computational load and 
  improving identification accuracy.  
- Developed and trained SVM classifiers on a minimized feature set; evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, leading to a 30% improvement 
  in overall model performance and reliability.
